# sentiment-analysis

In this repository, we examine which algorithms would be best applied for sentiment analysis of reddit posts.

Few that we have already implemented are: LabMT, Sent140Lex, VADER and HashtagSent

### Running the repository

To run the sentiment analysis, you need to make sure you have all the required datasets and you need to write:
`python3 test.py`
